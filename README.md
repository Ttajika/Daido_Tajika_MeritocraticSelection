# Meritocratic Selection and Coordination Neglect

This repository contains the simulation code underlying the numerical results in:

> Kohei Daido and Tomoya Tajika (2025),
> "Meritocratic Selection and Dynamics of Coordination Neglect in Hierarchical Organizations".

## Structure

- `merito_app/`: an interactive Streamlit application for exploring the model dynamics.



## Interactive application

This repository includes an interactive Streamlit application for exploring the model dynamics.

To run the app locally, install the required packages and execute:

```bash
pip install -r merito_app/requirements.txt
streamlit run merito_app/app.py
```
An interactive web application based on the same codebase is available at:
https://daido-tajika-meritocraticselection.onrender.com/

## Disclaimer
The interactive application is intended for exploratory purposes.
